"""
During a robbery, a burglar finds much more loot than he had expected and has to decide what to take.
His bag (or "knapsack") will hold a total weight of at most W pounds. There are n items to pick from.
Each item has its own weight and a dollar value.
What's the most valuable combination of items he can fit into his bag?
Different approaches are analysed and compared here: http://micsymposium.org/mics_2005/papers/paper102.pdf
